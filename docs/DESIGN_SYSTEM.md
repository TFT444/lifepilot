# Design System

LifePilot's design system is the shared visual and interaction language every feature is built from. It lives in code under [`DesignSystem/`](../DesignSystem/) and in brand assets under [`Assets/brand/`](../Assets/brand/); this document is the rationale and reference for both.

## Principles

1. **Calm by default.** LifePilot delivers information proactively; it should never feel like it's shouting. Motion, color, and density are used sparingly and purposefully.
2. **Explanation is a first-class UI element.** Every recommendation surface must have room for the "why," not just the "what" — see [Core Philosophy](../README.md#core-philosophy).
3. **One system, every surface.** iOS, macOS, and the future web dashboard draw from the same tokens, so LifePilot feels like one product wherever it's used.
4. **Accessible by construction.** Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, and sufficient contrast are requirements, not follow-up work — see [Engineering Guide](ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md#accessibility).

## Brand Mark

The LifePilot mark — the "L" merging into a circular swoosh around a sparkle — represents the product's core idea: fragmented signals (the open arc) resolving into one clear point of understanding (the sparkle). The source file is [`Assets/brand/logo.svg`](../Assets/brand/logo.svg); see [`Assets/brand/README.md`](../Assets/brand/README.md) for usage rules and how derived icon sizes are generated. Never redraw the mark from a screenshot — always derive from the source SVG.

## Color

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `color.background.primary` | `#05050F` (dark) / `#FFFFFF` (light) | App background |
| `color.background.elevated` | `#0A0A1A` (dark) / `#F5F5F7` (light) | Cards, sheets |
| `color.accent.primary` | `#7C3AED` → `#2563EB` gradient | Primary actions, brand moments |
| `color.text.primary` | `#FFFFFF` (dark) / `#111114` (light) | Primary text |
| `color.text.secondary` | `#9CA3C4` (dark) / `#6B7280` (light) | Secondary text, captions |
| `color.signal.risk` | `#E94560` | Conflicts, warnings, high-risk actions |
| `color.signal.success` | `#2EA44F` | Confirmed, approved, completed states |

Color tokens are defined once in `DesignSystem/Tokens/Color.swift` and referenced by name everywhere else — no feature module should hardcode a hex value.

## Typography

| Style | Weight | Size (pt) | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title.large` | Bold | 34 (at default content size) | Screen titles |
| `title.medium` | Semibold | 22 (at default content size) | Section headers |
| `body` | Regular | 17 (at default content size) | Primary content |
| `caption` | Medium | 13 (at default content size) | Metadata, timestamps |

Typography uses the system font (SF Pro) and scales with Dynamic Type by default: each token is built on `Font.system(_:design:weight:)`'s `TextStyle` factory (e.g. `.largeTitle`, `.body`) rather than a fixed point size, so scaling is native to the API rather than bolted on — see [Accessibility](ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md#accessibility). The point sizes above are Apple's standard sizes for each text style at the default content size, not arbitrary custom values.

## Spacing

An 8pt base grid: `spacing.xs` (4), `spacing.sm` (8), `spacing.md` (16), `spacing.lg` (24), `spacing.xl` (32). Components should compose from these tokens rather than introducing one-off values.

## Corner Radius

`DesignSystem/Tokens/CornerRadius.swift`: `sm` (8, badges/chips), `md` (16, standard cards and buttons), `lg` (24, prominent surfaces like `HeroCard` and sheets), `full` (999, pills and circular avatars).

## Icon Size

`DesignSystem/Tokens/IconSize.swift`: `sm` (20, inline icons), `md` (22, section/empty-state icons), `lg` (44, onboarding step icons), `xl` (56, hero-scale marks). Distinct from typography — these size standalone SF Symbols, not running text.

## Components

Core components live in `DesignSystem/Components/`, each with a `#Preview` and an entry in `DesignSystemCatalogView` (`DesignSystem/Catalog/`):

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BriefingCard` | Summarized unit of the Morning Briefing |
| `TimelineRow` | A single chronological entry in the Timeline |
| `ApprovalSheet` | Presents a recommended action with reasoning and approve/dismiss controls |
| `SignalBadge` | Small indicator for risk, success, informational, or priority signals |
| `AgentAvatar` | Visual identity for a given AI agent's output |
| `SectionHeader` | Titled section label with a leading SF Symbol, used to introduce a group of content |
| `EmptyStateView` | Inline "nothing here yet" card for a section that otherwise has content |
| `ComingSoonPlaceholder` | Full-screen placeholder for a tab or screen with no implementation yet |
| `QuickActionCard` | Small, icon-led tappable card for a single quick action |
| `HeroCard` | Large, prominent card reserved for the single most important content on a screen |
| `GhostCard` | Lightweight card for a single Ghost Brain signal or observation, distinct from the fuller `BriefingCard` |
| `InsightCard` | Stat-forward card for a single measured insight, with an optional trend indicator |
| `LoadingSkeleton` / `LoadingCardSkeleton` | Shimmering placeholder for content that hasn't loaded yet, Reduce-Motion aware |
| `AnimatedDivider` | A horizontal divider that draws itself in on appearance |
| `DesignSystemCatalogView` | Internal showcase rendering every component above together, for visual review |

## Modifiers

Shared `ViewModifier`s in `DesignSystem/Modifiers/`, extracted so common styling composes rather than duplicates across components:

| Modifier | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.lifePilotSurface(cornerRadius:fill:)` | The background-and-corner-radius pairing every elevated surface uses; `CardContainer` composes this with padding and a shadow |
| `.lifePilotGlass(cornerRadius:)` | The `.ultraThinMaterial` glass-chrome background used by `GlassSurface` and floating chrome |
| `.cardElevation(isElevated:)` | Toggles between the `card` and `elevated` `ShadowStyle` tokens, animated (skipped under Reduce Motion) |
| `.lifePilotPressable` (`ButtonStyle`) | Press-down scale/opacity feedback for tappable cards that aren't a plain text button |

## Theming

Light and dark themes are both first-class — not an inverted afterthought. Every token above has an explicit value in both modes, validated in CI via snapshot tests (see [Testing Strategy](ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md#testing-strategy)). Every `color.text.*` / `color.background.*` pairing has been checked against WCAG AA (4.5:1) for normal text; all pass with margin (the lowest, `color.text.secondary` on `color.background.primary` in light mode, is 4.83:1).

## Motion

Motion communicates causality — a card animating in should suggest *why* it appeared (e.g. a new signal was observed), not just draw attention. Default transitions are short (150–250ms) and use standard easing; anything longer needs a specific justification tied to what it's communicating.

`DesignSystem/Tokens/Motion.swift` adds `spring` (content that should feel alive on appearance), `press` (button/card press feedback), and `loading` (continuous shimmer for `LoadingSkeleton`) alongside the original `standard`/`quick`/`deliberate` tokens. Every continuous or decorative animation — as opposed to a state change the user directly triggered — is applied through `View.lifePilotAnimation(_:reduceMotion:value:)`, which resolves to no animation at all when `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` is `true`, per [Accessibility](ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md#accessibility).

## Status

The design system is being built out in **Phase 2 — UX/UI Design** of the [Master Roadmap](../MASTER_ROADMAP.md#phase-2--uxui-design). This document will grow alongside `DesignSystem/` as components are implemented — treat the tables above as the current source of truth, updated in the same PR as any token or component change.
